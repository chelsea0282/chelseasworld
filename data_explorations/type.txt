TWO MERCURIAN PEOPLE
YOKO ONO
I kept cutting my body to the point that finally I saw what
it's made of. It was made of clay. That was a relief. It was
also painful proof that I was alone. But still something in
me was pushing me to open the window. What I see when
I open the window is a snowfield. Some were still asleep.
I could not wait until he's awake. I was in total scare. 
There was no pencil, and what I wrote kept melting.
But there was some "..." in that situation. Is it more,
that that woman is cut off? I held my heands, it was so
cold.It made me realize that a woman's hand cannot be
anything but cold. I cannot be youched by anything. 
I need to be touched. I will disappear. I realized so many 
things while I was looking for a hand. It was not as though 
I wished the hand would hold me. The hand is like
an independent warm thing. It was busy looking for
something. Am I going to be like this forever? I cannot
feel. I hope the body can become supple and alive. 
I cannot allow myself to disappear before I write and
write. The snow keeps falling and I am talking to myself. 
Is that a woman's life? I was thinking you may want to hold
onto... At least that will not disappear. The whole body,
the blood of the body. Where did it go? I only hear my son's 
breathing. An international woman's day. It's what I wrote. 
Even if my whole body is cut off, I hear music. And I have to 
write right away. Life is a woman's life. A man seems to 
want their writings. Women seems to not even have a pencil.
